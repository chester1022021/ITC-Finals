Undoubtedly the most famous Bohol tourist destination and the province’s face, Chocolate Hills is composed of more than 1,000 symmetrical mounds, conical and dome-shaped that most people liken them to Hershey’s Kisses. It is called the Chocolate Hills not because it’s made of chocolate but because of its color.In the rainy season, the grass blanketing the hills gives them a soft and lush appearance. While in the summer, the vegetation dies off and turns to a chocolatey brown hue, giving them their name. For a more detailed guide to Chocolate Hills<p/>
