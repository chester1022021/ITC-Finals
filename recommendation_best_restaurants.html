						<h3 class="head-last">EDGE at Discovery Primea</h3>
							<div class="head-last">
								<img src="assets/images/recommendation_edge.jpg" width="500" height="600" >
								<p class="go-marg">Located on the 16th floor of luxurious Discovery Primea, and conveniently in the center of Makati's Central Business District, Edge is the ideal place for outdoor dinner and drinks. The view is spectacular. If, in 2020, you were confined to life within the four walls of home, Edge gives the sense of space and freedom you're craving with its 180-degree view of Metro Manila's cityscape. Perfect spot for moon-gazing.</p>

						<h3 class="head-last">Blackbird at the Nielson Tower</h3>
							<div class="head-last">
								<img src="assets/images/recommendation_blackbird.jpg" width="500" height="600">
								<p class="go-marg">We love the serene beauty of Blackbird's outdoor dining area, set inside the Ayala Triangle Gardens. It's a nice escape from bustling (and let's be honest, often constricting) city life, what with its organic design and seamless incorporation into the park that envelopes it.</p>	
								<br> To make a booking, please call (02) 8828-4888, (0917) 889-2782. </b>

						<h3 class="head-last">Maria Luisa's Garden Room at The Makati Garden Club</h3>
							<div class="head-last">
								<img src="assets/images/recommendation_maria.jpg"width="500" height="600">
								<p class="go-marg">Most people haven't heard of this place, which is no surprise because it's one of the oldest private dining restaurants in the city. Maria Luisa's Garden Room sits at the corner of EDSA and Ayala Avenue and is one of the most charming spaces in Manila. Come here for delectable French cuisine with a Scandinavian twist. Dining here is exclusive for members or friends of members, but it's worth signing up for.</p>

						<h3 class="head-last">LUSSO by Margarita Fores</h3>
							<div class="head-last">
								<img src="assets/images/recommendation_lusso.jpg" width="500" height="600">
								<p class="go-marg"> Remember when Greenbelt was a mall always teeming with life? It's quieter nowadays, but that somehow works for Lusso. Located in Greenbelt 5 in a strategic corner next to the mall's koi ponds, it's a lovely place for lunch or dinner, beautiful in the daytime and the evening.</p>

						<h3 class="head-last">The Test Kitchen MNL</h3>
						<div class="head-last">
							<img src="assets/images/recommendation_thetest.jpg" width="700" height="600">
							<p class="go-marg">If you're anything like us, you've lost count of how many times you've eaten Filipino homecooked meals and tasted the same flavors. It's a small price to pay for staying safe from getting sick, but should you really, really, and we mean really want to treat your taste buds to something exciting, The Test Kitchen MNL at Rockwell is ready to welcome you.</p>
